This package contains an MCP server designed to give Cascade access to the Unity Gaming Services cli as tool use. 
After installing this package, Windsurf IDE, in the Cascade chat, agent mode, will be able to take any action supported by the UGS CLI. 

To install:
Step 1
In Unity, open up the Package Manager, click the Add Package drop down and click "Install package from git url" and paste in: 
https://github.com/GauntletRunner2025/ugs-cli-mcp-package.git

If the package imports successfully, a welcome window should pop up and give further instructions. Otherwise, try the dropdown under Tools.

Step 2
The MCP server must be added to the list of servers your local windsurf instance knows about. It can be added automatically, unless you already have an mcp configuration, in which case you'll have to add it manually.
